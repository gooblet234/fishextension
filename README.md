# fishextension
extension fish
an extension that fishifies your sites; changing every single word to fish†, and every emoji to a fish, and occasionally, every image, but that depends on the website. Just install, check FiSH mode, and boom.
†you may have to reload, and it works AFTER clicking the checkbox in the extension popup
